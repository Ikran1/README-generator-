# README-generator-

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file

## Description

In this project I created an application using node.js that will help users generate a professional README file.Through the command line, the users are prompted to input key details about their project, such as the title, description, installation instructions, usage information, chosen license, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. The application then generates a well-structured README.md file, incorporating the information provided by the user into appropriate sections.

## Installation

- Install Node.js.
- Clone this repository.
- Open a terminal in the project directory.
- Run the command “npm install” to install the required dependencies.
- Execute the command “node index.js” to start the application.
- Follow the prompts to input information about your project.
- Once completed, a README.md file will be generated with the provided details.

## Usage

Below is a video demonstrating how the application works:
